        Hey Anil. Let's get the awkardness out of the way. Yes, I sent you three
        emails to two different email addresses. Yes, you didn't respond. That's
        okay! I understand. You might not have seen it, didn't think it was a
        good fit, or were just drafting your response! Call me
        <strike>annoying</strike> persistent, but I would love to work at Glitch
        this summer.
      </p>
      <p class="right-side">
        So as I'm sure you're aware, I would like to intern for Glitch this
        summer. So let's talk about my beliefs, and why I want to work at
        Glitch. (We'll maybe <i>reference</i> my experienes, but that's not what
        this site is for). P.S. If you've already read this far and also read my
        email and are already ready to say no, No worries. Just send a quick dm
        back on twitter :).
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="me">My Core Beliefs</h2>
    <div class="columns">
      <p class="left-side">
        My first core belief is <span style="color:#ff6ec7;">change.</span> I
        believe that if you don't think something is right, perfect, or where it
        needs to be, you have the power to do something about it. Whether it's
        something huge, like gun violence or climate change, or something small,
        like fixing a pipe in your sink. While some of that may come from my mom
        who insists that I never make my bed well enough, I firmly believe that
        change is a powerful and good force. I don't think any person,
        community, event, idea, culture, or project can't be changed for the
        better.
      </p>
      <p class="right-side">
        My next core belief is...<span style="color:#ff6ec7;">people</span>. Now
        let me guess what you're thinking - "What the hell does that mean?" Let
        me explain :) If I go to an airport, I'm joking around with the TSA
        agent, the people around me, and sometimes even the people who sit next
        to me on the plane. Whether it's at hackathons, model un conferences,
        debate tournaments, or protests, I'm always talking to as many people as
        I can, and making new friends. I love interacting with people and
        communities, and that's centered around what I want to do at Glitch, and
        part of the reason I love Hack Club so much.

    <h2 class="me">Why Glitch?</h2>
    <div class="columns">
      <p class="left-side">
        That's a great question Anil! Here's why: What I love about Glitch is
        that it makes coding more accessible—putting power in the hands of
        students. High schoolers can achieve so much when barriers are removed,
        whether in coding, politics, or even in public speaking, and that’s a
        mission I align myself with. These are problems I've tried tackling
        through Windy City Hacks, High School Democrats of America, and the
        debate team I’ve founded at my new school
      </p>
      <p class="right-side">
        If you couldn't tell from this website, I'm an activist and love change.
        Glitch is embracing change with their values and their culture. You
        openly call for accountability on yourself, openly strive to better your
        work culture, you're radically inclusive, and your platform embraces
        friendships and community. I want to embrace all of these things and run
        something I like to call the <b>Glitch Summer Games</b>
